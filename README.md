# Microservices Reference Application(BookStore)

> Polygot micro services reference bookstore application using Docker, Kubernetes and Istio

The mian purpose of this repository is to demonstrate a polygot micoservices reference architecture and best practices for containerized environments like Kubernetes. You can find an implementation showing all mordern day requirements you would expect from your platform using fully opensource technology stack. The core benefit of putting this repo is to have a open architecture and keep it up to date with the help of community.

## Motivation Behind Creating this Repo?
I was designing an architecture for one of our next generation internal application. The more I thought about the architecture, I realize how important is having an open architecture which can evolve based on current industry trends, best practices and open ideas from the awesome community. We are using this repository as our architecture playground for all of our products and I hope it can definely help many organization who are trying to adopt microservices. Having a adoptable and forward proof technology architecture is very critical for growing business now-a-days.
